# KhmerCoders Telegram Bot

## Introduction

This is a bot designed for the Khmer Coders telegram community. Its primary function is to track message counts for members within a group and generate leaderboards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhmerCoders/khmercoders-telegram-bot.git
   cd khmercoders-telegram-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

**Create `.dev.vars`**:
In the root directory, create a file named `.dev.vars` with the following structure:

```
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with the actual token you receive from BotFather (see "Telegram Bot Setup" below). This file is ignored by Git, so your token will not be committed to the repository.

### Running the Service

To start the bot locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Cloudflare worker on your local machine, accessible at `http://localhost:8787`.

### Database Management

This project utilizes Cloudflare D1 for database storage, with the schema defined within the `migrations` directory.

#### Development Migrations

To apply migrations to your local development database:

```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

#### Production Migrations

To apply migrations to the production database:

```bash
npm run migrate:prod
```

### Telegram Bot Setup

To integrate with Telegram:

1. **Create Your Bot**: Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. **Use `/newbot`**: Follow the prompts to create a new bot, choosing a name and username.
3. **Save Bot Token**: BotFather will provide you with a unique bot token. **Save this token**, as it's required for the `config.json` file.

#### Configuring the Webhook

After deploying your Cloudflare Worker, you must inform Telegram where to send updates. Set the webhook URL using the following command:

```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/webhook/telegram
```

**Remember to replace**:

- `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual Telegram bot token.
- `https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/webhook/telegram` with the URL of your deployed Cloudflare Worker.

## Cloudflare AI Gateway Setup

This bot utilizes a Cloudflare AI Gateway named `khmercoders-bot-summary-gw` for specific AI functionalities. You will need to create this gateway in your Cloudflare account to ensure the bot operates correctly.
